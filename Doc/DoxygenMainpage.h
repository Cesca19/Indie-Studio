    @section IndieStudioIntro Introduction
    Indie studio is a cross platform game development Engine for
    3D developpement in C++.

    @section IndieStudioTech Technology used
        Our Engine use  raylib, a very simple C library for 2D/3D graphics.
    As of today, 3D animation for .gltf models files is badly handled.
    We advised you to use multiple .obj files to animate your assets.
